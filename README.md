Hi Welcome to the coastLine Project:

This project uses a lot of technologies and frameworks:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Ajax
- Django
- Python
- PostgreSql

So when you start to run the project, the first step is to Activate virtual environments:
Activate:
...(put the way here)/RobertPrivateProjects/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 / in my computer: c:/Users/Usuario/Documents/GitHub/RobertPrivateProjects/venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

Deactivate:
deactivate

After you activate the project you will see (venv)PS, before that there is just a PS.

The project is activated and you need to see how the website works, put the run server command:
run server:
python manage.py runserver

And that is it, the project is working.
